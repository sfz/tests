/// Test description:
/// Play c4, verify it's tuned with other instruments in the set.
///
/// 'pitch_keycenter' instructs the player on what key will play the sample
/// without transposing.
///
/// Note that while the player will read most properties from the sample file
/// (loop start/end/length, loop count, loop direction, loop mode), the root
/// note declared in the sample will be -ignored-.
