/// Test group: voice groups
/// Test purpose: polyphony
///
/// Test description:
/// This test shows how to create 'voice groups' or 'polyphony groups'.
/// The first region (below c4) is assigned to group 1, and its polyphony is 
/// restrained to seven notes. The second region (c4 to b4) is assigned to
/// group 2, and allowed to play one voice.
/// The third region (c5 to g9) is also assigned to group 2, so it will share
/// polyphony with the second region.
///
/// The player 'polyphony' will determinate the maximum amount of voices that
/// all regions will play.
///
/// Polyphony stealing is performed following a few 'smart' rules (low voice not
/// stealed, steal notes in delay stage, then the oldest, etc).
