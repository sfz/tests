/// Test purpose: polyphony
///
/// Test description:
/// Play several notes, verify that total polyphony is limited to 12 notes.
/// Play repeatedly the same note, verify that the note polyphony is limited
/// to 3 notes. As the 'note_selfmask' is off, if the new note has lower velo-
/// city than any of the sounding notes (for the same note), a high-velocity
/// note will be turned off, resulting in a somehow uncool effect. However, 
/// this setting will preserve the maximum note polyphony within specified limit.
