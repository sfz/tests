/// Test group: input controls
/// Test purpose: sample selection on legato playing
///
/// Test description:
/// Play several notes staccatto: 440.ogg will play untransposed.
/// Play several notes legato (new note is pressed before last one is
/// released). 440.ogg will play untransposed the first note, but
/// it'll play one octave down for the legato notes.
///
/// This approach makes extremely simple to select samples for true legato
/// or to select an alternate region with a different start point, attack, 
/// or whatever the sample needs when in legato.
///
/// This is not the test for the typical synthesizer mono/legato mode.
