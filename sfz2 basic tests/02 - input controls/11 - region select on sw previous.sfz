/// Test description:
/// bd.wav will only play if last played note was c4 (MIDI note 60).
///
/// This is very handy to select a sample based on the played interval,
/// for instance, when playing c4 and then f4 the player could trigger
/// a real sample of a violin player doing the c4~f4 interval for utmost
/// realism (vsl-like legato playing).
