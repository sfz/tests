/// Test group: release trigger
/// Test purpose: release trigger decay
///
/// Test description:
/// Play any key, then release it.
/// The second region will play on note release (110.wav).
///
/// Verify that the release trigger plays softer if the note is held longer.
///
/// Release triggers were originally introduced by Gigastudio on the late 90's
/// Some of the applications for release triggers include playing samples of
/// key-off or string-off noises, like the noise generated by a piano mechanism
/// when the hammer returns to the rest position. Currently, several sample 
/// libraries (PMI, GOS, VSL, SAM, EWQLSO, etc) use the release trigger to 
/// reinject the original decay of the hall where the recording was performed to 
/// a long note. So you play, for instance, the trumpet, and make it last as long
/// as you wish. When you release the note, another sample is triggered containing
/// the last instant of the note and the hall decay. 
/// With appropriate crossfading settings between the sustain and release trigge-
/// red layers, an outstanding realism can be achieved.
///
/// For instruments with natural decay (i.e. Piano), the adjust of the release
/// trigger volume is tricky. Gigastudio offers only four different decay levels
/// sfz allows to specify a db/second ratio, specified by the 'rt_decay' opcode.
